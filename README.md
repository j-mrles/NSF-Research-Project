## Introduction
Hi there! I'm deeply passionate about making software programming accessible to everyone, especially those without a prior background in coding. Recognizing the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as educational tools, my project aims to leverage them to teach software programming to non-programmers. Through a combination of video tutorials, study plans, and prompt engineering, I believe we can democratize the learning process of software development.

## Project Objectives
The main goals of my project are threefold:
1. **Evaluate Different LLMs**: To start, I'm assessing various LLMs to identify which are most effective at teaching programming concepts to beginners. This involves comparing their ability to generate understandable, accurate, and pedagogically valuable content.
   
2. **Develop Language-Based Training Materials**: Drawing on the insights gained, I'm creating a suite of language-based tutorials and study plans tailored for non-programmers. These resources aim to introduce fundamental programming concepts and languages in a digestible, engaging manner.
   
3. **Identify Strengths and Weaknesses of LLMs**: A critical part of my research is analyzing the pros and cons of using LLMs as teaching aids. By understanding their limitations and areas of strength, I hope to integrate LLMs with traditional teaching methods to offer a comprehensive learning experience.

## Methodology
My approach is built on mixed methods that include:
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Comparing the effectiveness of different LLMs through metrics like user comprehension, retention rate, and the ability to apply learned concepts.
- **Qualitative Feedback**: Gathering insights from learners about their experiences, including the clarity of the material, engagement level, and overall satisfaction.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Using feedback and data to refine tutorials, study plans, and teaching strategies continuously.

## Why This Matters
Software programming is a critical skill in today's digital world, but the learning curve can be steep for those without a technical background. By harnessing the power of LLMs, I aim to create a more inclusive, effective, and engaging way to learn programming. This project not only has the potential to empower individuals with new skills but also to inspire innovative approaches in education technology.

## Get Involved
I'm always looking for collaborators, feedback, and ideas. Whether you're an educator, programmer, or someone curious about learning to code, I'd love to hear from you. Together, we can make software programming accessible to everyone.

This project represents a journey into the intersection of artificial intelligence and education. I believe that by exploring innovative tools like LLMs, we can redefine what it means to learn programming and open up new possibilities for learners across the globe.
